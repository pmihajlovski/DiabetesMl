# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes progression in patients using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains demographic, lifestyle, and medical information about patients, including age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The goal is to develop predictive models that can accurately predict diabetes progression based on these features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset from the scikit-learn library. It consists of 442 samples and 10 features, along with the target variable indicating diabetes progression one year after baseline measurements.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression. The models are trained, hyperparameters are tuned using cross-validation, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared score.
